# Five To Seven - Endpoints


**Name:** Elizabeth Trotter

**Mini Challenge Scope:** Design an API with 4 endpoints based on mini challenges from the Combine: 
- each endpoint must have their own Controller file, inside a Controller folder
- Also, each one must have their own service file, inside a Service folder
- Validation is required.

Endpoints:
1. MadLib: create an endpoint that accepts multiple inputs.  Output should be a story based on those values.

2. OddOrEven: create an endpoint that displays if a number entered is odd or even.

3. ReverseIt (Alphanumeric): endpoint that accepts a sequence of numbers and letters then reverses them.  For example:
    - "You entered 123ABC, reversed is CBA321"

4. ReverseIt (Numbers Only): endpoint that accepts a sequence of only numbers and reverses them. Be sure to display the original characters before the reversed. For example:
    - "You entered 12345, reversed is 54321"
